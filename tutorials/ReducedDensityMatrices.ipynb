    "First, look at the definition of the reduced density matrices (RDM) for some state $ |\\psi\\rangle = U |0\\rangle^{\\otimes N_q}$ on an $N_q$-qubit system. In a **minimal** basis, this corresponds to $N_p = N_q/2$ particles/molecular orbitals. \n",

    "\n",
    "2-RDM $ \\gamma^{pq}_{rs} \\equiv \\langle \\psi | a^p a^q a_s a_r | \\psi\\rangle$ (we mainly use the standard physics ordering for the second-quantized operators, i.e. $p,r$ go with particle 1 and $q,s$ with particle 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators $ a^p = a_p^\\dagger $ and $a_p$ denote the standard fermionic creation and annihilation operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that since we only consider real orbitals in chemistry applications, the implementation also expects only real-valued RDM's.\n",
    "The well-known anticommutation relations yield a series of symmetry properties for the reduced density matrices, which can be taken into consideration to reduce the computational cost:\n",

    "In chemistry applications, solving the electronic structure problem with the electronic Hamiltonian (here in Born-Oppenheimer approximation)\n",
    "$$ H_{el} = \\sum_{pq} h^q_p a^p_q + \\sum_{pqrs} h^{rs}_{pq} a^{pq}_{rs}$$\n",
    "with the one- and two-body integrals $h^q_p, h^{rs}_{pq}$ turns out to be independent of spin. Thus it makes sense, to perform computations in terms of molecular, and not spin-orbitals ($N_p < N_q$, see above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we introduce the spin-free RDMs $\\Gamma^P_Q$ and $\\Gamma^{PQ}_{RS}$, obtained by spin-summation:\n",
    "$$ \\Gamma^P_Q = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}} \\gamma^{p\\sigma}_{q\\sigma} = \\langle \\psi |\\sum_{\\sigma} a^{p\\sigma} a_{q\\sigma} | \\psi\\rangle $$\n",

    "Note, that by making use of linearity, we obtain the second equality in the two expressions above. Performing the summation before evaluating the expected value means less expected values and a considerable reduction in computational cost. \n",
