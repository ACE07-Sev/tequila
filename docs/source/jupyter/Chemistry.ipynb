    "# Tequila Chemistry Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show the basics of the tequila chemistry module.  \n",
    "In order for this to work you need to have psi4 installed in the same python environment as tequila.  \n",
    "If you are in a conda environment installing psi4 is easy:\n",
    "`conda install psi4 -c psi4`  \n",
    "But better check the [psi4 website](http://www.psicode.org/) for up to date instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases problems with the environment were observed which are suspected to originate from conflicts between psi4 and tequila dependcies. Usually the safest way is to install psi4 **first** and then install tequila\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic functionality is currently also provided with PySCF which might be easier to install. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment we only support closed-shell molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will give an overview over:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialization of molecules within tequila\n",
    "- Usage of different qubit encodings from openermion (JW, BK, BKSF, Tapered-BK)\n",
    "- Using basic functionality of Psi4 with tequila\n",
    "- Setting up active spaces\n",
    "- Constructing UCC based quantum circuits with tequila\n",
    "\n",
    "**There might be issues with psi4 and jupyter, currently the workarround is to reload the kernel before a cell gets executed, or run as a regular python script**"
